# FinanceRAG
Python + LangChain + HuggingFace to create a Finance RAG

This is a simple web app that uses Python/LangChain. You may upload file(s) via the front-end file uploader. The documents are then stored in a vector database which is passed into an OpenAI API. From here, we are able to ask questions about the document(s) uploaded and retrieve answers.
